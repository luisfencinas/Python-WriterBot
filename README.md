Purpose: Breakdown a file into a number of prefixes and it's suffixes.
        hashing these prefixes and putting suffixes into matching location in
        list. Then randomly picking a number of words based off of first prefix
        and picking next word from prefix in hashtable, changing prefix to include
        that word and repeat until it hits an end or produces all words.
